Script collects sources from the web and generates a DKMS package directory. It may be useful if you need to add an existing linux kernel module to a system where this module wasn't included and doesn't supported as a package. In case you need to use a patched kernel module it will be also helpful.

To generate a DKMS package directory:
1. Change your current directory to a project directory.
2. Call a build-dkms-dir.sh script with or without arguments:
    Use --pack (-p) argument to pack the output directory into gzipped tarball.
    Use --checksum (-s) argument to calculate and save checksum (MD5 at the current version) of your output tarball.
    Use --clean (-c) argument to clean previous script autput automatically.
3. If the project has more the one website for module sources you will be asked to select the one you prefer more.
4. Check the project directory to get your DKMS package directory, tarball (if you requested one) and checksum file (if the option selected).

Usage: build-dkms-dir.sh [--pack | -p] [--clean | -c] [--help | -h] [--version | -V]
    [--pack | -p] - pack an output directory to a gzipped tarball;
    [--checksum | -s] - calculate tarball's checksum;
    [--clean | -c] - clean all previous script output, if exists (DKMS package directory, tarball and checksum);
    [--help | -h] - print usage information (this text);
    [--version | -V] - print script version.

Project directory contents:
1. dkms.conf - a DKMS package configuration file.
    Example:
        PACKAGE_NAME=<your_module_name>
        BUILT_MODULE_NAME[0]=<package_name_0> or "$PACKAGE_NAME"
        DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[0]=<module_location_0>
    WARNING: Make sure BUILT_MODULE_NAME and DEST_MODULE_LOCATION arrays have the same order if your package have more than one module.
        Incorrect array order causes script malfanction! The best choice to keep both arrays' elements in increasing order.
    Hint: It's not obligatory to keep this file in the project directory. If script can't find this file it'll try to download it from the selected web source.
    WARNING: Makefile will be downloaded from the website URL directory if selected kernel sorces root website! 
2. Makefile - a DKMS package makefile.
    WARRNING: Don't forget to update "obj-m" variable if you use a make file from one of the example projects!
    HINT: It's not obligatory to keep this file in the project directory. If script can't find this file it'll try to download it from the selected web source.
    WARNING: A DKMS package configuration file will be downloaded from the website URL directory if selected kernel sorces root website! 
3*. SOURCES - this file contains website URLs where the rest of project's resorces located.
    Place URL per line. Kernel sources root expected as default.
    Example:
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master
    HINT: If you want to fetch files from the not kernel sorces root (NKSR), place an exclamatory symbol (!) at the start of your URL.
    Example:
        !https://raw.githubusercontent.com/someuser/someproject/master
4*. INCLUDES - the file contains file names you want to include in the DKMS package directory.
    Place a file name per line. As default all files treated as local.
    Example:
        README
    HINT: If you want to get your include file from the website, place a colon symbol (:) before the file name. The remote included file also can be ether relative path or URL.
    Example:
        :README
        :../somedir/README
        :https://raw.githubusercontent.com/someuser/someproject/master/README
    WARNING: All file names and relative paths will be downloaded from the website URL directory if selected kernel sorces root website! 
5. You can present a local source file for one or more modules. Script won't load a new source file for this modules and won't delete them
    during cleaning phase.
6. Files from INCLUDE file. Script will stop execution if any file from INCLUDE isn't presented.
* You can skip this files if your project don't need them.
WARNING: All files have to be with Unix line ending except your environment says other! Incorrect line ending causes script malfanction!
